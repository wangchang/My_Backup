# Spine theme #

Thank you for trying out Spine, a responsive WordPress theme that leverages the power of Hybrid Core, the most advanced theme framework, by Justin tadlock and Zurb Foundation, a front end HTML and CSS framework.

## Features ##

**Spine is highly customizable**, so that you can make it your own:

- Custom Header Image
- Custom Background Image
- Pick the colors for the headlines, the main content and the links.
- Custom footer text with shortcodes.
- Select different layouts, globally or per page.

**Spine is responsive:**
Mobile responsive multi-level menus, 2 different styles.
Uses the Foundation responsive grid.

## Templates: ##
Full width, Content-sidebar and Sidebar-Content, plus an extra page template controlled by widget areas.

Spine is translation ready and has a RTL stylesheet.

## Note about the Top Bar navigation menu:  ##
The top bar menu is activated by assigning a custom menu to the secondary menu location.
There is an important restriction for this menu: it will not wrap when there are more top level items that fit on one line.
 Well, it does wrap, but it is not usable.
