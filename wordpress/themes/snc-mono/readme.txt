Important!

Width of this theme is 900 px, many internet users still use 1024 x 768 px resolution on their displays so it's best for them but since menu is horizontal that gives a limited number of tabs and it's important to keep that in mind.

Hope you'll find my theme of use. Suggestions, bug reports and donations are welcome. If you wish to invite me to any "web" kind of project then feel free to ask.

Enjoy,
